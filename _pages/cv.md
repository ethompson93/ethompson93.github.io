## Outreach

* Participated in a speed networking session with 20 secondary school students as part of the EAST Careers Week 2023. Answered questions about life as a researcher, and my route into science.
* Mentor on the Apply Competitively to STEM (A-COMPS) programme at UCL (Sprint 2022 - Summer 2023). Providing academic and personal support to an A-level student from an under-represented background
* Theme Leader at Pint of Science, Nottingham, 2019. Led a team to organise a series of talks around the theme of technology for the general public.

## Other Activities

* I was a member of the organising committee for the MICCAI 2024 International Workshop of Computational Diffusion MRI [CDMRI 2024](http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/cdmri/).
* I was a session chair at the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), for the featured research session "Tau accumulation and tau spreading patterns II"
* From April 2022 - April 2024 I organised monthly Brain Connectivity seminars at UCL. I was responsible for organising the seminars, inviting speakers, and promoting the events.
* I participated in [NeuroHack 2022](https://demondementia.com/neurohack2022/), a competitive international hackathon. I was part of a team working on the challenge "Machine learning for dementia diagnosis in the United States and India". We developed an app for low-cost Dementia screening: [https://researchmind.co.uk/readi-dem/](https://researchmind.co.uk/readi-dem/) and sucessfully applied for a Â£10,000 pilot grant to continue our work on the project. The work has since been published as a [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.23.23297405v1).
