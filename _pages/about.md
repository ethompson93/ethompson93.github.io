I am a Research Fellow in the [POND Group](https://ucl-pond.github.io/) at UCL. I am working on methods for brain connectivity estimation that allow us to quantify the uncertainty in our measurements. These connectivity estimates will inform disease progression models, to better understand neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism.

I completed my PhD in 2021 in the [Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory](https://spmic-uon.github.io/conilab/) at the University of Nottingham.
