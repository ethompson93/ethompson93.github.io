I am a postdoctoral researcher at UCL, working on computational methods for mapping connections in the human brain. As a member of the [Progression Of Neurodegenerative Disease (POND) Group](https://ucl-pond.github.io/), I am also interested in leveraging these techniques to improve modelling of pathology spread in Alzheimer's disease. You can find some of this work [here](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00089/119149/Combining-multimodal-connectivity-information) and [here](https://github.com/ucl-pond/network_spreading_models).


## Previous Work

I completed my PhD in 2021 in the [Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory](https://spmic-uon.github.io/conilab/) at the University of Nottingham, supervised by Professor Stam Sotiropoulos and Dr Matteo Bastiani. During my PhD, I developed new methods for exploring white matter connections in the neonatal brain. 

A key part of my PhD project was a new framework for data-driven connectivity mapping (paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192030759X)). We used non-negative matrix factorisation to extract white matter connectivity patterns and their corresponding grey matter networks from whole-brain connectivity matrices. This provides a way of extracting white matter bundles from tractography data, without the need for pre-defined regions of interest.

I also developed a new set of tractography protocols for neonates, based on the XTRACT framework. The protocols allow automated tracking of 42 white matter bundles that are equivalently defined for the adult human and macaque, and are included in [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/XTRACT). We used these protocols to define a common space to study changes in brain connectivity through development and across different species (paper [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq2022)).
