## Current Role
I have recently started a postdoctoral position at UCL in the [POND Group](https://ucl-pond.github.io/). I am working on methods to improve the accuracy of brain connectivity estimation, through a Bayesian inference framework that will enable us to quantify the uncertainty in these measurements. These connectivity estimates will inform disease progression models, to improve our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease.

## Previous Work

I completed my PhD in 2021 in the [Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory](https://spmic-uon.github.io/conilab/) at the University of Nottingham, supervised by Professor Stam Sotiropoulos and Dr Matteo Bastiani. During my PhD, I developed new methods for exploring white matter connections in the neonatal brain. 

Data-driven connectivity mapping (paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192030759X)).

I also developed a new set of tractography protocols for neonates, based on the [XTRACT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920304092) framework. The protocols allow automated tracking of 42 white matter bundles, and can be found on my Github page [here](https://github.com/ethompson93/baby-XTRACT). *paper coming soon*.

## Other Interests
I am interested in sustainability, and how we can reduce our environmental impact in the neuroimaging community. I am part of the OHBM Sustainability and Environmental Action Group https://ohbm-environment.org/ .
