I am a postdoc at UCL, working in the [Progression Of Neurodegenerative Disease (POND) Group](https://ucl-pond.github.io/). I am developing computational techniques to improve the accuracy of brain connectivity mapping, and applying these to the modelling of pathology spread in neurodegenerative disease. 

My [previous work](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00089/119149/Combining-multimodal-connectivity-information) has shown that combining connectivity estimates from different sources (such as tractography and functional MRI) can improve the accuracy of these models. I have also contributed to an [open source toolbox](https://github.com/ucl-pond/network_spreading_models) for network spreading models.


## Previous Work

I completed my PhD in 2021 in the [Computational Neuroimaging Laboratory](https://spmic-uon.github.io/conilab/) at the University of Nottingham, supervised by Professor Stam Sotiropoulos and Dr Matteo Bastiani. During my PhD, I developed new methods for exploring white matter connections in the neonatal brain. 

A key part of my PhD project was a new framework for data-driven connectivity mapping (paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192030759X)). We used non-negative matrix factorisation to extract white matter connectivity patterns and their corresponding grey matter networks from whole-brain connectivity matrices.

I also developed a new set of tractography protocols for neonates, based on the XTRACT framework. The protocols allow automated tracking of 42 white matter bundles that are equivalently defined for the adult human and macaque, and are included in [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/XTRACT). We used these protocols to define a common space to study changes in brain connectivity through development and across different species (paper [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq2022)).
