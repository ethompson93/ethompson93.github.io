Co-led a group project for 11 MSc students on the Computational Modelling for Biomedical Imaging Module. The project was entitled: "Predicting spread of Alzheimerâ€™s disease pathology using brain connectomes from different cognitive stages". I developed course materials, led lab sessions where we answered questions from the students, and marked their project reports.
